### [**Scipy 2019: Hands-on Satellite Imagery Analysis**](https://github.com/samapriya/remote-sensing-with-python)
Satellite data is more widely available than ever before, and it is now possible for the public to access sub-weekly and even daily imagery of the Earth's entire landmass. In this tutorial, gain hands-on experience exploring Planet’s publicly-available satellite imagery and using Python tools for geospatial and time-series analysis of medium- and high-resolution imagery data. Using free & open source libraries, learn how to perform foundational imagery analysis techniques and apply these techniques to real satellite data. At the end of the workshop, we’ll demonstrate how the skills you've learned can be applied to investigate real-world environmental and humanitarian challenges.
