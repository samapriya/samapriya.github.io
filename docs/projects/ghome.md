# [ghome: Simple CLI for Google Home & Mini](https://github.com/samapriya/ghome)
This is an application of the google home API Blueprint reported [here](https://github.com/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi). While a lot of the end points maybe of interest to quite a few people, I used the ones I use most and I thought would be most useful and created a command line tool for you to search for a Google home mini device and then use this tool to interact with it and perform actions as needed.

## Installation
This assumes that you have native python & pip installed in your system, you can test this by going to the terminal (or windows command prompt) and trying

```python``` and then ```pip list```

If you get no errors and you have python 2.7.14 or higher you should be good to go. Please note that I have tested this only on python 2.7.15, but it should run on Python 3.

To install **ghome: Simple CLI for Google Home & Mini** you can install using two methods.

```pip install ghome```

or you can also try

```
git clone https://github.com/samapriya/ghome.git
cd ghome
python setup.py install
```
For Linux use sudo or try ```pip install ghome --user```.

Installation is an optional step; the application can also be run directly by executing ghome.py script. The advantage of having it installed is that ghome can be executed as any command line tool. I recommend installation within a virtual environment. If you don't want to install, browse into the ghome folder and try ```python ghome.py``` to get to the same result.


## Getting started

As usual, to print help:

```
usage: ghome [-h] {list,reboot,alarm,dnd,bstat,bscan,bpair,bdisc,wscan} ...

To obtain help for specific functionality, simply call it with _help_ switch, e.g.: `ghome wscan -h`. If you didn't install ghome, then you can run it just by going to *ghome* directory and running `python ghome.py [arguments go here]`
