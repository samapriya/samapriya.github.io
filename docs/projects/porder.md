[Ordersv2 is the next iteration of Planet's API](https://developers.planet.com/docs/orders/) in getting Analysis Ready Data (ARD) delivered to you. Orders v2 allows you to improved functionality in this domain, including capability to submit an number of images in a batch order, and perform operations such as top of atmospheric reflectance, compression, coregistration and also enhanced notifications such as email and webhooks. Based on your access you can use this tool to chain together a sequence of operations. This tool is a command line interface that allows you to interact with the ordersv2 API along with place orders and download orders as needed. The tool also allows you to chain multiple processes together and additional functionalities will be added as needed. For exporting to cloud storages release 0.0.8 onwards has a configuration folder with config yml structures to be used with this tool. Simply replaces the fields as needed.

**Please note: This tool is in no way an official tool or Planet offering, but is a personal project created and maintained by Samapriya Roy**

## Prerequisites
This assumes that you have native python & pip installed in your system, you can test this by going to the terminal (or windows command prompt) and trying. I recommend installation within virtual environment if you are worries about messing up your current environment.

```python``` and then ```pip list```

If you get no errors and you have python 2.7.14 or higher you should be good to go.

**This command line tool is dependent on shapely and fiona and as such uses functionality from GDAL**
For installing GDAL in Ubuntu
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa && sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
sudo apt-get install python-gdal
```
For Windows I found this [guide](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:UZWc-pnCgwsJ:https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/tutorials/installing-gdal-for-windows+&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) from UCLA

Also for Ubuntu Linux I saw that this is necessary before the install

```sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev```

## Installing porder
Once you have shapely and the other libraries configured, to install **porder: Simple CLI for Planet ordersv2 API** you can install using two methods

```pip install porder```

For linux I found it helps to specify the pip type and use --user

```
pip install porder --user

or

pip3 install porder --user
```

or you can also try

```
git clone https://github.com/samapriya/porder.git
cd porder
python setup.py install
```

## Windows Setup
Shapely and a few other libraries are notoriously difficult to install on windows machines so follow the steps mentioned here **before installing porder**. You can download and install shapely and other libraries from the [Unofficial Wheel files from here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) download depending on the python version you have. **Do this only once you have install GDAL**. I would recommend the steps mentioned above to get the GDAL properly installed. However I am including instructions to using a precompiled version of GDAL similar to the other libraries on windows. You can test to see if you have gdal by simply running

```gdalinfo```

in your command prompt. If you get a read out and not an error message you are good to go. If you don't have gdal try Option 1,2 or 3 in that order and that will install gdal along with the other libraries

#### Option 1:
Starting from porder v0.4.5 onwards:

Simply run ```porder -h``` after installation. This should go fetch the extra libraries you need and install them. Once installation is complete, the porder help page will show up. This should save you from the few steps below.

#### Option 2:
If this does not work or you get an unexpected error try the following commands. You can also use these commands if you simply want to update these libraries.

```
pipwin refresh
pipwin install gdal
pipwin install pyproj
pipwin install shapely
pipwin install fiona
pipwing install geopandas
```

#### Option 3
For windows first thing you need to figure out is your Python version and whether it is 32 bit or 64 bit. You can do this by going to your command prompt and typing python.

![windows_cmd_python](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/63856293-3dfc2b80-c96f-11e9-978d-d2c1a01cfe36.PNG)

For my windows machine, I have both 32-bit python 2.7.16 and 64-bit Python 3.6.6. You can get the python version at the beginning of the highlighted lines and the 32 or 64 bit within the Intel or AMD64 within the square brackets. Your default python is the one you get by just typing python in the command line. Then download the following packages based on the information we collect about our python type in the earlier step. We use unofficial binaries to install these. This step is only needed if you are on a windows machine if you are using a setup manager like anaconda you **might** be able to avoid this setup completely

At this stage **if you were unable to install gdal then download the gdal binaries first**, install that before everything else

gdal: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal)

Then follow along the following libraries
* pyproj: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj)
* shapely: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely)
* fiona: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona)
* geopandas: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#geopandas](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#geopandas)

To choose the version that is correct for you use the python information you collected earlier
For example for my python 3.6.6 and AMD 64 if I was installing shapely I would choose the following, here 36 means python 3.6 and amd64 refers to the 64bit we were talking about.

```Shapely‑1.6.4.post2‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl```

You will get a wheel file or a file ending with .whl. You can now simply browse to the folder or migrate to it in your command prompt. Once there if I am installing for my python 3.6 the command was. At this point we will make use of our trusted package installer that comes with python called pip. Note the choice of pip or pip3 depends on your python version usually you can get the pip to use with your python by typing


```pip3 -V```

you get a readout like this

```pip 18.1 from c:\python3\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.6)```

if you have pip just replace that with ```pip -V```

Then simply install the wheel files you downloaded using the following setup

```
pip3 install full path to Shapely‑1.6.4.post2‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl

in my case that would be

pip3 install "C:\Users\samapriya\Downloads\Shapely‑1.6.4.post2‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl"
```

Or you can use [anaconda to install](https://conda-forge.github.io/). Again, both of these options are mentioned on [Shapely’s Official PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/).


## Getting started

Make sure you initialized planet client by typing ```planet init```. As usual, to print help:

![porder_main](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/61379317-4ee85600-a875-11e9-9234-5f57dccf9588.png)

To obtain help for a specific functionality, simply call it with _help_ switch, e.g.: `porder idlist -h`. If you didn't install porder, then you can run it just by going to *porder* directory and running `python porder.py [arguments go here]`

## porder Simple CLI for Planet ordersv2 API
The tool is designed to simplify using the ordersv2 API and allows the user to chain together tools and operations for multiple item and asset types and perform these operations and download the assets locally.

### porder version
This prints the tool version and escapes. Simple use would be

```
porder version
```

### porder quota
Just a simple tool to print your planet subscription quota quickly.

![porder_quota](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53096751-d19afe00-34ed-11e9-9e10-b2c894800cbe.png)

### base64
This does exactly as it sounds, it encodes your credential files to base64 for use with gcs.

![porder_base64](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53096754-d495ee80-34ed-11e9-980d-418601bc975a.png)

### shape to geojson
This tool allows you to convert from  a folder with multiple shapefiles to a folder with geojson that can then be used with the tool. It makes use of geopandas and reprojects your shapefile to make it compatible while passing onto the API for search and download.

![porder_shp2geojson](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/56938418-d1137a80-6acf-11e9-9e03-953ae367445f.png)

### simplify
This reduces the number of vertices for a multi vertex and complex GeoJSON. Extremely high vertex count (over 500) seem to fail and hence this tool allows you to export a new geojson with reduced vertices. It uses an implementation of the Visvalingam-Wyatt line simplification algorithm. This tool does work with and without Fiona, but Fiona installation is recommended.

![porder simplify](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/56763793-36ced200-6771-11e9-8b61-8f94b1f61152.png)

### idlist
Create an idlist for your geometry based on some basic filters,including geometry, start and end date and cloud cover. If no cloud cover is specified everything form 0 to 100% cloud cover is included. For now the tool can handle geojson,json and kml files. The output is a csv file with ids. The tool also allows you to make sure you get percentage overlap, when selecting image, for clip operations adjust it accordingly (usally --ovp 1 for orders not to fail during clip). The tool now also prints estimated area in Square kilometes for the download and estimated area if you clipped your area with the geometry you are searching (just estimates).

**I have changed the setup to now do the following two things**

* The number option is optional, so it can look for all images in the time range, but be careful if the area is too large, _use at own risk_. A better option is to supply the number.

* It is possible to often forget about the different asset types, so you can now not pass an item and the script will return every possible type of asset for each item type depending on the bundle.

![porder_idlist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25802584/55653649-2e602880-57bd-11e9-9d43-3587d2021d6f.png)

A simple setup would be
![porder_idlist_setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53096128-6e5c9c00-34ec-11e9-9ddd-767f96d603b0.png)

To run an experiment to add additional filter, you can now pass an additional string or range filter or both flag for string and range filters, a setup would be. The additional filters are optional

```
porder idlist --input "Path to geojson file" --start "YYYY-MM-DD" --end "YYYY-MM-DD" --item "PSScene4Band" --asset "analytic" --outfile "Path to idlist.csv" --filters range:clear_percent:55:100 --number 20

porder idlist --input "Path to geojson file" --start "YYYY-MM-DD" --end "YYYY-MM-DD" --item "PSScene4Band" --asset "analytic" --outfile "Path to idlist.csv" --filters string:satellite_id:"1003,1006,1012,1020,1038" --number 20

porder idlist --input "Path to geojson file" --start "YYYY-MM-DD" --end "YYYY-MM-DD" --item "PSScene4Band" --asset "analytic" --outfile "Path to idlist.csv" --filters string:satellite_id:"1003,1006,1012,1020,1038" range:clear_percent:55:100 --number 20
```

The idlist tool can now use a multipolygon and iteratively look for scenes.

### difflist
It is possible you already downloaded some images or metadata files, and your you want a difference idlist to create orders for only assets and item types you do not have. It takes in your local folder path, type image or metadata and some basic filters,including geometry, start and end date and cloud cover. If no cloud cover is specified everything form 0 to 100% cloud cover is included. For now the tool can handle geojson,json and kml files. The output is a csv file with ids.

![porder_difflist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25802584/54535868-dc6a7680-4965-11e9-8047-250c568f10e1.png)

A simple setup would be
![porder_diffcheck_setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53096408-14100b00-34ed-11e9-8ee1-8c49e8145aef.png)

or without the cloud filter

![porder_diffcheck_nocloud_setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53096598-8a147200-34ed-11e9-8583-8ceaa93da65d.png)

### idsplit
This allows you to split your idlist into small csv files incase you wanted to created batches of orders.

![porder_idsplit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25802584/54536155-877b3000-4966-11e9-9a32-9a4379eef0f7.png)

A simple setup would be
![porder_idsplit_setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53097536-b204d500-34ef-11e9-8a6c-e2d52986d90c.png)

### idcheck
It is possible for you to modify the idlist, add or remove ids. Once done, this tool allows you to estimate the total area of images and area that intersect with your geometry or area if clipped.

![porder_idcheck](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/57543905-c05ed200-7323-11e9-9afb-09613ffffd06.png)

A simple setup would be
![porder_idcheck_setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/57543933-d5d3fc00-7323-11e9-946f-200a4791f5e8.png)

### bundles
Ordering using ordersv2 uses the concept of bundles. A bundle is a combination of multiple assets for an item that come together and are delivered as part of the overall fulfillment of the order. For example an analytic asset for PSScene4Band is a single tif file, however the analytic bundle for PSScene4Band includes analytic tiff file, the analytic_xml metadata and the udm data mask file as part of the bundle. You can find more information about [bundles here](https://developers.planet.com/docs/orders/product-bundles-reference/). Thus the concept of bundles bring together single function to order and download multiple related assets. Since the list of bundles is long, this tool simply allows you to get every bundle type based on item type. The setup is simple

![porder_bundles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/61171622-48da3880-a548-11e9-829f-d8c71dc39ce5.png)

A simple setup would be

```
porder bundles --item "PSScene4Band"
```

### order
This tool allows you to actually place the order using the idlist that you created earlier. the ```--op``` argument allows you to take operations, delivery and notifications in a sequence for example ```--op toar clip email``` performs Top of Atmospheric reflectance, followed by clipping to your geometry and send you an email notification once the order has completed, failed or had any any change of status. An important changes is the concept of passing bundles instead of using assets. The list of operations for the ```--op``` are below and ** the order of these operations is important**

clip|toar|comp
                        osite|zip|zipall|compression|projection|kernel|aws|azu
                        re|gcs|email <Choose indices from>:
                        ndvi|gndvi|bndvi|ndwi|tvi|osavi|evi2|msavi2|sr

------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
clip | Clip imagery can handle single and multi polygon verify or create geojson.io
toar | Top of Atmosphere Reflectance imagery generated for imagery
harmonize| Harmonize Dove R (instrument type PS2.SD) data to classic dove (instrument type PS)
composite | Composite number of images in a given order
zip | Zip bundles together and creates downloads (each asset has a single bundle so multiple zip files)
zipall | Create a single zip file containing all assets
compression | Use image compression
projection | Reproject before downloaing image
aws | Option called to specify delivery to AWS
azure | Option called to specify delivery to AZURE
gcs | Option called to specify delivery to GCS
email | Email notification to your planet registered email

</center>


You can now add some predefined indices for PlanetScope 4 band items with a maximum of 5 indices for a single setup . This is experimental. The list of indices include

A simple setup with image clip with email notification would be

![porder_clip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/61171619-48da3880-a548-11e9-8e7c-4059866e68f5.png)

The same setup with delivery of each image, its metadata as a zip file would be. Note how we only added zip to the op list

![porder_clip_zip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/61171620-48da3880-a548-11e9-9c96-1d12ca762ca4.png)

A simple setup with Top of Atmospher reflectance and a few indices along with email notification would be

![porder_indices](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6677629/61171621-48da3880-a548-11e9-8ab9-c3a3658c7d5b.png)


### ordersize
The tool now allows you to estimate the total download size for a specific order.

![porder_ordersize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53097620-e4163700-34ef-11e9-893b-73551d485c83.png)

An example setup look like the following

<center>

![ordersize](/images/ordersize.png)

</center>

### stats
The tool allows you to check on number of running and queued orders for both organization and user level. Using this is simple

```
porder stats
```

output should look like this:

```
Checking on all running orders...
Total queued order for organization: 0
Total running orders for organization: 1

Total queued orders for user: 0
Total running orders for user: 0
```

### download
The allows you to download the files in your order, to a local folder. It uses the order url generated using the orders tool to access and download the files.

![porder_download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53097694-11fb7b80-34f0-11e9-92bd-3b841ab8b3df.png)

### multipart download
The allows you to multipart download the files in your order, this uses a multiprocessing downloader to quickly download your files to a local folder. It uses the order url generated using the orders tool to access and download the files.

![porder_multipart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53097736-2b042c80-34f0-11e9-9724-68e9ed356ab7.png)

### multiprocessing download
The uses the multiprocessing library to quickly download your files to a local folder. It uses the order url generated using the orders tool to access and download the files and includes an expotential rate limiting function to handle too many requests. To save on time it uses an extension filter so for example if you are using the zip operation you can use ".zip" and if you are downloading only images, udm and xml you can use ".tif" or ".xml" accordingly. For python 3.4 or higher, this switches to using an true async downloader instead of using multiprocessing.

![porder_multiprocessing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53097786-4707ce00-34f0-11e9-9e79-78ba1d4ba27c.png)

A simple setup would be

![porder_multiproc_setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28806922/53097885-71f22200-34f0-11e9-88dd-c60c9cd03f6c.png)
