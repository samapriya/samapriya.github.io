If you didn't install geeadd, then you\ncan run it just by going to \ngeeadd\n directory and running \npython\ngeeadd.py [arguments go here]\n\n\nBatch uploader\n\n\nThe script creates an Image Collection from GeoTIFFs in your local\ndirectory. By default, the collection name is the same as the local\ndirectory name; with optional parameter you can provide a different\nname. Another optional parameter is a path to a CSV file with metadata\nfor images, which is covered in the next section:\n\nParsing metadata\n.\n\n\nusage: geeadd.py upload [-h] -u USER --source SOURCE --dest DEST [-m METADATA]\n                        [--large] [--nodata NODATA]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n\nRequired named arguments.:\n  -u USER, --user USER  Google account name (gmail address).\n  --source SOURCE       Path to the directory with images for upload.\n  --dest DEST           Destination. Full path for upload to Google Earth\n                        Engine, e.g. users/johndoe/myponycollection\n\nOptional named arguments:\n  -m METADATA, --metadata METADATA\n                        Path to CSV with metadata.\n  --large               (Advanced) Use multipart upload. Might help if upload\n                        of large files is failing on some systems. Might cause\n                        other issues.\n  --nodata NODATA       The value to burn into the raster as NoData (missing\n                        data)\n\n\n\n\nParsing metadata\n\n\nBy metadata we understand here the properties associated with each image. Thanks to these, GEE user can easily filter collection based on specified criteria. The file with metadata should be organised as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilename (without extension)\n\n\nproperty1 header\n\n\nproperty2 header\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfile1\n\n\nvalue1\n\n\nvalue2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfile2\n\n\nvalue3\n\n\nvalue4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that header can contain only letters, digits and underscores. \n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_no\n\n\nclass\n\n\ncategory\n\n\nbinomial\n\n\nsystem:time_start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_file_1\n\n\nGASTROPODA\n\n\nEN\n\n\nAaadonta constricta\n\n\n1478943081000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_file_2\n\n\nGASTROPODA\n\n\nCR\n\n\nAaadonta irregularis\n\n\n1478943081000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe corresponding files are my_file_1.tif and my_file_2.tif. With each of the files five properties are associated: id_no, class, category, binomial and system:time_start. The latter is time in Unix epoch format, in milliseconds, as documented in GEE glosary. The program will match the file names from the upload directory with ones provided in the CSV and pass the metadata in JSON format:\n\n\n{ id_no: my_file_1, class: GASTROPODA, category: EN, binomial: Aaadonta constricta, system:time_start: 1478943081000}\n\n\n\n\nThe program will report any illegal fields, it will also complain if not all of the images passed for upload have metadata associated. User can opt to ignore it, in which case some assets will have no properties.\n\n\nHaving metadata helps in organising your asstets, but is not mandatory - you can skip it.\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\nEE User\n\n\nThis tool is designed to allow different users to change earth engine authentication credentials. The tool invokes the authentication call and copies the authentication key verification website to the clipboard which can then be pasted onto a browser and the generated key can be pasted back\n\n\nUpload a directory with images to your myfolder/mycollection and associate properties with each image:\n\n\ngeeadd upload -u johndoe@gmail.com --source path_to_directory_with_tif -m path_to_metadata.csv --dest users/johndoe/myfolder/myponycollection\n\n\n\n\nThe script will prompt the user for Google account password. The program will also check that all properties in path_to_metadata.csv do not contain any illegal characters for GEE. Don't need metadata? Simply skip this option.\n\n\nUpload a directory with images with specific NoData value to a selected destination\n\n\ngeeadd upload -u johndoe@gmail.com --source path_to_directory_with_tif --dest users/johndoe/myfolder/myponycollection --nodata 222\n\n\n\n\nIn this case we need to supply full path to the destination, which is helpful when we upload to a shared folder. In the provided example we also burn value 222 into all rasters for missing data (NoData).\n\n\nAsset List\n\n\nThis tool is designed to either print or output asset lists within folders or collections using earthengine ls tool functions.\n\n\nusage: geeadd lst [-h] --location LOCATION --type TYPE [--items ITEMS]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\n  --location LOCATION  This it the location of your folder/collection\n  --type TYPE          Whether you want the list to be printed or output as\n                       text(print/report)\n  --items ITEMS        Number of items to list\n\n\n\n\nTask Query\n\n\nThis script counts all currently running and ready tasks along with failed tasks.\n\n\nusage: geeadd.py tasks [-h]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n\ngeeadd.py tasks\n\n\n\n\nTask Query during ingestion\n\n\nThis script can be used intermittently to look at running, failed and ready(waiting) tasks during ingestion.

By default, the collection name is the same as the local\ndirectory name; with optional parameter you can provide a different\nname. Another optional parameter is a path to a CSV file with metadata\nfor images, which is covered in the next section:\n\nParsing metadata\n.\n\n\nusage: geeadd.py upload [-h] -u USER --source SOURCE --dest DEST [-m METADATA]\n                        [--large] [--nodata NODATA]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n\nRequired named arguments.:\n  -u USER, --user USER  Google account name (gmail address).\n  --source SOURCE       Path to the directory with images for upload.\n  --dest DEST           Destination. Full path for upload to Google Earth\n                        Engine, e.g. users/johndoe/myponycollection\n\nOptional named arguments:\n  -m METADATA, --metadata METADATA\n                        Path to CSV with metadata.\n  --large               (Advanced) Use multipart upload. Might help if upload\n                        of large files is failing on some systems. Might cause\n                        other issues.\n  --nodata NODATA       The value to burn into the raster as NoData (missing\n                        data)\n\n\n\n\nParsing metadata\n\n\nBy metadata we understand here the properties associated with each image. Thanks to these, GEE user can easily filter collection based on specified criteria. The file with metadata should be organised as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilename (without extension)\n\n\nproperty1 header\n\n\nproperty2 header\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfile1\n\n\nvalue1\n\n\nvalue2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfile2\n\n\nvalue3\n\n\nvalue4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that header can contain only letters, digits and underscores. \n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_no\n\n\nclass\n\n\ncategory\n\n\nbinomial\n\n\nsystem:time_start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_file_1\n\n\nGASTROPODA\n\n\nEN\n\n\nAaadonta constricta\n\n\n1478943081000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_file_2\n\n\nGASTROPODA\n\n\nCR\n\n\nAaadonta irregularis\n\n\n1478943081000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe corresponding files are my_file_1.tif and my_file_2.tif. With each of the files five properties are associated: id_no, class, category, binomial and system:time_start. The latter is time in Unix epoch format, in milliseconds, as documented in GEE glosary. The program will match the file names from the upload directory with ones provided in the CSV and pass the metadata in JSON format:\n\n\n{ id_no: my_file_1, class: GASTROPODA, category: EN, binomial: Aaadonta constricta, system:time_start: 1478943081000}\n\n\n\n\nThe program will report any illegal fields, it will also complain if not all of the images passed for upload have metadata associated. User can opt to ignore it, in which case some assets will have no properties.\n\n\nHaving metadata helps in organising your asstets, but is not mandatory - you can skip it.\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\nUsage examples have been segmented into two parts focusing on both planet tools as well as earth engine tools, earth engine tools include additional developments in CLI which allows you to recursively interact with their python API\n\n\nPlanet Tools\n\n\nThe Planet Toolsets consists of tools required to access control and download planet labs assets (PlanetScope and RapidEye OrthoTiles) as well as parse metadata in a tabular form which maybe required by other applications.\n\n\nPlanet Key\n\n\nThis tool basically asks you to input your Planet API Key using a password prompt this is then used for all subsequent tools\n\n\nusage: ppipe.py planetkey [-h]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n\n\n\n\nIf using on a private machine the Key is saved as a csv file for all future runs of the tool.\n\n\nAOI JSON\n\n\nThe aoijson tab within the toolset allows you to create filters and structure your existing input file to that which can be used with Planet's API. The tool requires inputs with start and end date, along with cloud cover. You can choose from multiple input files types such as KML, Zipped Shapefile, GeoJSON, WKT or even Landsat Tiles based on PathRow numbers. The geo option asks you to select existing files which will be converted into formatted JSON file called aoi.json. If using WRS as an option just type in the 6 digit PathRow combination and it will create a json file for you.\n\n\nusage: ppipe.py aoijson [-h] [--start START] [--end END] [--cloud CLOUD]\n                        [--inputfile INPUTFILE] [--geo GEO]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --start START         Start date in YYYY-MM-DD?\n  --end END             End date in YYYY-MM-DD?\n  --cloud CLOUD         Maximum Cloud Cover(0-1) representing 0-100\n  --inputfile INPUTFILE\n                        Choose a kml/shapefile/geojson or WKT file for\n                        AOI(KML/SHP/GJSON/WKT) or WRS (6 digit RowPath\n                        Example: 023042)\n  --geo GEO             map.geojson/aoi.kml/aoi.shp/aoi.wkt file\n\n\n\n\nActivate or Check Asset\n\n\nThe activatepl tab allows the users to either check or activate planet assets, in this case only PSOrthoTile and REOrthoTile are supported because I was only interested in these two asset types for my work but can be easily extended to other asset types. This tool makes use of an existing json file sturctured for use within Planet API or the aoi.json file created earlier\n\n\nusage: ppipe.py activatepl [-h] [--aoi AOI] [--action ACTION] [--asst ASST]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help       show this help message and exit\n  --aoi AOI        Choose aoi.json file created earlier\n  --action ACTION  choose between check/activate\n  --asst ASST      Choose between planet asset types (PSOrthoTile\n                   analytic/REOrthoTile analytic/PSOrthoTile\n                   analytic_xml/REOrthoTile analytic_xml\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Asset\n\n\nHaving metadata helps in organising your asstets, but is not mandatory - you can skip it.\nThe downloadpl tab allows the users to download assets. The platform can download Asset or Asset_XML which is the metadata file to desired folders.One again I was only interested in these two asset types(PSOrthoTile and REOrthoTile) for my work but can be easily extended to other asset types.\n\n\nusage: ppipe.py downloadpl [-h] [--aoi AOI] [--action ACTION] [--asst ASST]\n                           [--pathway PATHWAY]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help         show this help message and exit\n  --aoi AOI          Choose aoi.json file created earlier\n  --action ACTION    choose download\n  --asst ASST        Choose between planet asset types (PSOrthoTile\n                     analytic/REOrthoTile analytic/PSOrthoTile\n                     analytic_xml/REOrthoTile analytic_xml\n  --pathway PATHWAY  Folder Pathways where PlanetAssets are saved exampled\n                     ./PlanetScope ./RapidEye\n\n\n\n\nMetadata Parser\n\n\nThe metadata tab is a more powerful tool and consists of metadata parsing for PlanetScope OrthoTile RapiEye OrthoTile along with Digital Globe MultiSpectral and DigitalGlobe PanChromatic datasets. This was developed as a standalone to process xml metadata files from multiple sources and is important step is the user plans to upload these assets to Google Earth Engine. The combine Planet-GEE Pipeline tool will be made available soon for testing.\n\n\nusage: ppipe.py metadata [-h] [--asset ASSET] [--mf MF] [--mfile MFILE]\n                         [--errorlog ERRORLOG]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\n  --asset ASSET        Choose RapidEye/PlantScope/DigitalGlobe\n                       MultiSpectral/DigitalGlobe Panchromatic\n                       (RE/PS/DGMS/DGP)?\n  --mf MF              Metadata folder?\n  --mfile MFILE        Metadata filename to be exported along with Path.csv\n  --errorlog ERRORLOG  Errorlog to be exported along with Path.csv\n\n\n\n\nEarth Engine Tools\n\n\nThe ambition is apart from helping user with batch actions on assets along with interacting and extending capabilities of existing GEE CLI. It is developed case by case basis to include more features in the future as it becomes available or as need arises. This is also a seperate package for earth engine users to use and can be downloaded \nhere\n\n\nEE User\n\n\nThis tool is designed to allow different users to change earth engine authentication credentials. The tool invokes the authentication call and copies the authentication key verification website to the clipboard which can then be pasted onto a browser and the generated key can be pasted back\n\n\nUpload a directory with images to your myfolder/mycollection and associate properties with each image:\n\n\ngeeadd upload -u johndoe@gmail.com --source path_to_directory_with_tif -m path_to_metadata.csv --dest users/johndoe/myfolder/myponycollection\n\n\n\n\nThe script will prompt the user for Google account password. The program will also check that all properties in path_to_metadata.csv do not contain any illegal characters for GEE. Don't need metadata? Simply skip this option.\n\n\nUpload a directory with images with specific NoData value to a selected destination\n\n\ngeeadd upload -u johndoe@gmail.com --source path_to_directory_with_tif --dest users/johndoe/myfolder/myponycollection --nodata 222\n\n\n\n\nIn this case we need to supply full path to the destination, which is helpful when we upload to a shared folder. In the provided example we also burn value 222 into all rasters for missing data (NoData).\n\n\nTask Query\n\n\nThis script counts all currently running and ready tasks along with failed tasks.\n\n\nusage: geeadd.py tasks [-h]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n\ngeeadd.py tasks\n\n\n\n\nTask Query during ingestion\n\n\nThis script can be used intermittently to look at running, failed and ready(waiting) tasks during ingestion. This script is a special case using query tasks only when uploading assets to collection by providing collection pathway to see how collection size increases.\n\n\nusage: geeadd.py taskquery [-h] [--destination DESTINATION]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --destination DESTINATION\n                        Full path to asset where you are uploading files\n\ngeeadd.py taskquery \nusers/johndoe/myfolder/myponycollection\n                       \n\n\n\n\nTask Report\n\n\nSometimes it is important to generate a report based on all tasks that is running or has finished. Generated report includes taskId, data time, task status and type\n\n\nusage: geeadd.py report [-h] [--r R] [--e E]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n  --r R       Path \n CSV filename where the report will be saved\n  --e E       Path \n CSV filename where the errorlog will be saved\n\ngeeadd.py report --r \nreport.csv\n --e \nerrorlog.csv\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete a collection with content:\n\n\nThe delete is recursive, meaning it will delete also all children assets: images, collections and folders. Use with caution!\n\n\ngeeadd delete users/johndoe/test\n\n\n\n\nConsole output:\n\n\n2016-07-17 16:14:09,212 :: oauth2client.client :: INFO :: Attempting refresh to obtain initial access_token\n2016-07-17 16:14:09,213 :: oauth2client.client :: INFO :: Refreshing access_token\n2016-07-17 16:14:10,842 :: root :: INFO :: Attempting to delete collection test\n2016-07-17 16:14:16,898 :: root :: INFO :: Collection users/johndoe/test removed\n\n\n\n\nDelete all directories / collections based on a Unix-like pattern\n\n\ngeeadd delete users/johndoe/*weird[0-9]?name*\n\n\n\n\nAssets Move\n\n\nThis script allows us to recursively move assets from one collection to the other.\n\n\nusage: geeadd.py mover [-h] [--assetpath ASSETPATH] [--finalpath FINALPATH]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --assetpath ASSETPATH\n                        Existing path of assets\n  --finalpath FINALPATH\n                        New path for assets\ngeeadd.py mover --assetpath \nusers/johndoe/myfolder/myponycollection\n --destination \nusers/johndoe/myfolder/myotherponycollection\n                  \n\n\n\n\nAssets Copy\n\n\nThis script allows us to recursively copy assets from one collection to the other.

We also assume Planet Python API is installed you can install by simply running \n\n\npip install planet\n\n\n\n\nFurther instructions can be found \nhere\n \n\n\nYou require two important packages for this to run\n\n\nWxPython(which is what the GUI is built on)\nfor windows(Tested in Windows 10)\nhttps://wxpython.org/download.php\n\nfor linux(Tested in Ubuntu 16)\nsudo add-apt-repository \ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu utopic main restricted universe\n  \nsudo apt-get update\napt-cache search python-wxgtk3.0\nsudo apt-get install python-wxgtk3.0\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\nUsage examples have been segmented into two parts focusing on both planet tools as well as earth engine tools, earth engine tools include additional developments in CLI which allows you to recursively interact with their python API. To run the tool open a command prompt window or terminal and type\n\n\npython ee_ppipe.pyc\n\n\n\n\nPlanet Tools\n\n\nThe Planet Toolsets consists of tools required to access control and download planet labs assets (PlanetScope and RapidEye OrthoTiles) as well as parse metadata in a tabular form which maybe required by other applications.\n\n\nPlanet Key\n\n\nThis tool basically asks you to input your Planet API Key using a password prompt this is then used for all subsequent tools\n\n\n\n\nIf using on a private machine the Key is saved as a csv file for all future runs of the tool.\n\n\nAOI JSON\n\n\nThe aoijson tab within the toolset allows you to create filters and structure your existing input file to that which can be used with Planet's API. The tool requires inputs with start and end date, along with cloud cover. You can choose from multiple input files types such as KML, Zipped Shapefile, GeoJSON, WKT or even Landsat Tiles based on PathRow numbers. The geo option asks you to select existing files which will be converted into formatted JSON file called aoi.json. If using WRS as an option just type in the 6 digit PathRow combination and it will create a json file for you.\n\n\n\n\nActivate or Check Asset\n\n\nThe activatepl tab allows the users to either check or activate planet assets, in this case only PSOrthoTile and REOrthoTile are supported because I was only interested in these two asset types for my work but can be easily extended to other asset types. This tool makes use of an existing json file sturctured for use within Planet API or the aoi.json file created earlier\n\n\n\n\nDownload Asset\n\n\nHaving metadata helps in organising your asstets, but is not mandatory - you can skip it.\nThe downloadpl tab allows the users to download assets. The platform can download Asset or Asset_XML which is the metadata file to desired folders.One again I was only interested in these two asset types(PSOrthoTile and REOrthoTile) for my work but can be easily extended to other asset types.\n\n\n\n\nMetadata Parser\n\n\nThe metadata tab is a more powerful tool and consists of metadata parsing for PlanetScope OrthoTile RapiEye OrthoTile along with Digital Globe MultiSpectral and DigitalGlobe PanChromatic datasets. This was developed as a standalone to process xml metadata files from multiple sources and is important step is the user plans to upload these assets to Google Earth Engine. The combine Planet-GEE Pipeline tool will be made available soon for testing.\n\n\n\n\nEarth Engine Tools\n\n\nThe ambition is apart from helping user with batch actions on assets along with interacting and extending capabilities of existing GEE CLI. It is developed case by case basis to include more features in the future as it becomes available or as need arises. This is also a seperate package for earth engine users to use and can be downloaded \nhere\n\n\nEE User\n\n\nThis tool is designed to allow different users to change earth engine authentication credentials. The tool invokes the authentication call and copies the authentication key verification website to the clipboard which can then be pasted onto a browser and the generated key can be pasted back\n\n\n\nUpload a directory with images to your myfolder/mycollection and associate properties with each image:\n\n\n\n\nThe script will prompt the user for Google account password. The program will also check that all properties in path_to_metadata.csv do not contain any illegal characters for GEE. Don't need metadata? Simply skip this option.\n\n\nTask Query\n\n\nThis script counts all currently running and ready tasks along with failed tasks.\n\n\n\n\nTask Query during ingestion\n\n\nThis script can be used intermittently to look at running, failed and ready(waiting) tasks during ingestion. This script is a special case using query tasks only when uploading assets to collection by providing collection pathway to see how collection size increases.\n\n\n\n\nTask Report\n\n\nSometimes it is important to generate a report based on all tasks that is running or has finished. Generated report includes taskId, data time, task status and type\n\n\n\n\nDelete a collection with content:\n\n\nThe delete is recursive, meaning it will delete also all children assets: images, collections and folders. Use with caution!\n\n\n\n\nAssets Move\n\n\nThis script allows us to recursively move assets from one collection to the other.\n\n\n\n\nAssets Copy\n\n\nThis script allows us to recursively copy assets from one collection to the other. If you have read acess to assets from another user this will also allow you to copy assets from their collections.\n\n\n\n\nAssets Access\n\n\nThis tool allows you to set asset acess for either folder , collection or image recursively meaning you can add collection access properties for multiple assets at the same time.\n\n\n\n\nSet Collection Property\n\n\nThis script is derived from the ee tool to set collection properties and will set overall properties for collection. \n\n\n\n\nConvert to Fusion Table\n\n\nOnce validated with gdal and google fusion table it can be used to convert any geoObject to google fusion table. Forked and contributed by Gennadii \nhere\n. The scripts can be used only with a specific google account\n\n\n\n\nCleanup Utility\n\n\nThis script is used to clean folders once all processes have been completed.
